# Heart-Disease-Classification
This project aims to develop a machine-learning model to predict whether a patient has heart disease or not based on attributes like age, sex, cholesterol level, blood pressure, etc.

### Prerequisites
* Python 3
* Jupyter Notebook
* Scikit-learn
* Pandas
* NumPy
* Matplotlib

### Instructions
* Clone the repository.
`git clone https://github.com/iamharshvardhan/Heart-Disease-Classification.git`
* Open the Heart_Disease_Classification.ipynb Jupyter Notebook.
* Run the cells in the notebook to train and evaluate the machine-learning model.

### Results
The machine learning model (`RandomForestClassifier`) achieves an accuracy of 92% on the test set.
